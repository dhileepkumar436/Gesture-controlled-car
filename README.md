## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Control the car's movements with hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Video Feed**: See what the car sees through a real-time video feed.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and extend the code for your own projects.
- **Responsive**: The car responds smoothly and in real-time to your gestures.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to contribute and improve this project.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenCV
- Arduino nano (or any compatible microcontroller)
- nRF24l01+module
- nRF24 adapter
- MPU6050 module

## Usage

Improved Accessibility: Gesture control can make driving more accessible to individuals with physical disabilities who may have difficulty using traditional controls. It can also benefit people with temporary injuries or limitations.

Reduced Driver Distraction: By eliminating the need to reach for physical controls or look at touchscreens, gesture control can help reduce driver distraction, enhancing safety on the road.

Advanced Infotainment: Gesture control can be used to interact with the car's infotainment system, allowing drivers and passengers to adjust settings, change music, answer calls, and access navigation without taking their hands off the wheel.

Enhanced Safety: In addition to reducing distractions, gesture controls can be used to activate safety features like emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, or even summoning help in the event of an accident.

Simplified Interfaces: Gesture-controlled cars can simplify the user interface by reducing the number of physical buttons and knobs in the cabin, leading to a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing design.

Customization: Users can potentially customize gestures to suit their preferences. For example, a specific hand gesture could be programmed to trigger a particular function or command.

Multimodal Interaction: Gesture control can be combined with other modes of interaction, such as voice commands and touchscreens, to create a multimodal interface that offers flexibility and convenience.

Autonomous Vehicles: In self-driving cars, gesture control can still be valuable for manual override or input when necessary. Passengers can use gestures to take control of the vehicle in specific situations.
